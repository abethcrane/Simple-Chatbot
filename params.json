The spreadsheet adding aspect required reading a couple of different sources and combining lines from here and there (and writing a few of my own :P)\r\n\r\n* http://code.google.com/p/pygtalkrobot/ \r\n* http://pseudoscripter.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/automatically-update-spreadsheets-and-graphs-part-2/ \r\n* http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/write-google-spreadsheet-from-python/ \r\n* http://gdata-python-client.googlecode.com/hg/pydocs/gdata.spreadsheet.service.html\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
